Hondo
=========
The gift of the Cochise. 

Hondo is the media management hub for all of your [Buffaloes](https://github.com/amoose/buffalo). With Hondo, you can manage all of your media distribution needs from a single, beautiful, web interface. Each one of your Buffaloes, patiently await commands to download (and distribute) your media across your Hondo Community. 


## Common applications

  - Create a Buffalo on your HTPC to manage your home media. 
  - Add a Buffalo on your Grandmother's PC and push pictures of the grandkids to her screensaver. 
  - Long distance relationship? Get her a Buffalo for her birthday and watch shows *together* over the interwebs. 

    > Manage them all with Hondo!



### How it works

  - Hondo and his trusty sidekick, [Banner](https://github.com/amoose/banner), create a [Content Delivery Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) for your media. 
  - Each [Buffalo](https://github.com/amoose/buffalo) authenticates with Hondo to dilligently download and distribute your media.
